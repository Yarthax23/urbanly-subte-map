## Day 0 – Planning

* Reviewed datasets and available formats
* Decided to normalize data into GeoJSON for MapLibre compatibility
* Chose TypeScript for better structure and self-documentation (explicit data models and safer refactoring)
    
## Research

* Review MapLibre GL JS basic map initialization
* Understand how to add GeoJSON sources and layers
* Inspect subway datasets fields and relationships
* Decide GeoJSON structure for lines and stations
